Description: Somoclu is a cluster-oriented implementation of self-organizing maps. It 			     relies on MPI for distributing the workload, and it can be accelerated by 			     CUDA on a GPU cluster. A sparse kernel is also included, which is useful for 		     training maps on vector spaces generated in text mining processes.
